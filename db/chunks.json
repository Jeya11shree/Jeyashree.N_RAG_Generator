Verification emails not received sometimes due to mail provider rate limits. - Symptoms: delivery failures in logs, users report not receiving verification emails. - Mitigation: implement retry queue and circuit-breaker for external email provider. 3. Weak password accepted on client due to missing server validation in older deployments. - Symptoms: user accounts created with weak passwords; security concern. - Mitigation: ensure server-side password policy enforcement and add unit tests. 4.

The flow is designed to be simple, secure, and resilient to common failure modes (duplicate accounts, weak passwords, expired verification tokens). ## Goals - Allow new users to create accounts with email + password. - Enforce password policy and provide clear inline validation. - Prevent duplicate accounts for the same email. - Send verification email with single-use token and expiry. - Provide resend verification with throttling. ## Stakeholders - Product: onboarding conversion - Engineering: backend, email service, security - QA: test coverage for happy/negative/boundary cases ## User Stories - As an unauthenticated user, I can create an account using my email and a password so I can access the product. - As a user, I should receive a verification email and verify my address before sensitive flows. - As a user, I should",
